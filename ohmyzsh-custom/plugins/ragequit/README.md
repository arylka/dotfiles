# Ragequit

This plugin gives you control over your unresponsive programs and your
uncontrolled rage by killing your programs with the magic words
`fuck you` or `fuck off` for a more powerful response.

## Instructions

There are two main usage modes:

- `fuck you <process_name>`: this will send a normal kill signal (SIGTERM).
  If that doesn't kill the process, try `fuck off`.

- `fuck off <process_name>`: this will send a force-kill signal (SIGKILL).

If you have something else to say, arguments after the first two are ignored,
so you can get out all the rage inside you in one nifty command:

```sh
$ fuck you chrome you stupid memory-devouring monster
```
